## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to perform an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the IPL dataset. We aim to uncover insights regarding team performance, individual player statistics, venue advantages, and factors influencing match outcomes.

## Dataset Information
The dataset contains information on IPL matches, teams, and individual performances. The main features of the dataset include:
- **Match data**: Date, venue, teams, results
- **Player data**: Runs scored, wickets taken, and strike rates
- **Venue data**: City, stadium
- **Other**: Toss details, match result (win by runs/wickets)

## Installation and Setup
To run the analysis locally, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/IPL-EDA.git
   cd IPL-EDA
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook IPL_EDA.ipynb
   ```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Data Cleaning
Initial steps in the analysis include:
- Handling missing values
- Removing or fixing duplicates
- Converting data types

### Data Visualization
We use various libraries such as **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualizing the dataset.

Here are some of the key visualizations:
1. **Win Distribution by Teams**

## Key Insights
- Teams winning the toss tend to choose batting or bowling based on the venue's conditions.
- The highest number of runs are typically scored at specific venues.
- Certain players consistently perform well across different IPL seasons.

## Results
The EDA revealed various important aspects of IPL matches, such as:
- **Winning strategies**: Factors influencing a teamâ€™s win, like toss decision and home ground advantage.
- **Player performance**: Identifying top performers by runs, wickets, and other critical metrics.
- **Venue analysis**: Key grounds where teams tend to perform better.
